<p><p>Yet another post testing the whole workflow.</p>
<p>I realized that when I publish from Netlify CMS, the new post is pushed to Github, but I need to pull it down to my local instance on my laptop.  Otherwise my local instance will be out of sync with the published version.<br>
<br>
In the previous post (#2), the image is a link to an external url, so no image file was added to the project.  In this post, I'll upload an image to see if the file is added to the project's images/uploads folder.<br>
<br>
I also need to style this thing.  I need to figure out how to use CSS with 11ty.</p>
