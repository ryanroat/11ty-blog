<p><p>I had an issue where the file path to images generated was not using the root of the project, but troubleshooting it was, well, troublesome.</p>
<p>In my first three posts I had images derived in three different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first post's image was coded directly in the eleventy front matter by me, as it was a test post as the site was being built, before the Netlify CMS was implemented.</li>
<li>The second post was a link to an external image URL added via the CMS.</li>
<li>The third post had an image uploaded from my local machine via the CMS.</li>
</ol>
<p>I discovered that the site generation was dropping the / from the front of the image src url, which turned out to be an issue in the CMS config.  After mucking around a bit I finally updated the CMS config to use the same folder, but added a ./ to the lead to make it use the root of the project.</p>
<p>I also had to reselect all images in the CMS and republish each page.  Thankfully, it was only three pages.  I also change post 2 to have an image uploaded to the CMS rather than reference an external URL.  I need to test if an external URL will work after these updates.<br>
<br>
Finally, I need to make the images clickable to full size.  That's a good start for tomorrow's list of enhancements.</p>
